Bears vs Zombies (a satirical game, that doesn't take itself too seriously)

Written in Java with libGDX.

A game I began working on in the Winter Break of 2015 just after exams. After struggling with A* Path Finding, the project was discontinued to work on the AI seperately. This was also because of the workload of school. I may return to the project in the future.

The premise is simple: A bear wakes up late from hibernation to find out that the human species has gone nearly instinct. There are few survivors, but plenty of zombies. How will the bear survive? Will he just go back to hibernation?
